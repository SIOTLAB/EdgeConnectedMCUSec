## Overview

With a wide range of applications and the rise of cyberattacks, securing MCUs has
become imperative; however, ensuring MCU performance is also crucial given
how interconnected todayâ€™s systems are. This project examines the security and
performance of next-generation microcontroller units (MCUs) leveraging new
security solutions for IoT edge applications. By benchmarking these MCUs against
key performance metrics, their viability will be assessed to facilitate the widespread
adoption of this new firmware.

This project utilizes the STM32 toolchain and Nordic Semiconductor PPK II along with the nRF software. See the slides for more information.

## Navigation

To navigate to source code, choose a project (i.e UnoI2C) and select the `Core` directory for non-secure projects or the `Secure` directory and then the `Core` directory for secure projects. Within `Core` there should be an `Src` folder which contains the code used to build the selected application.
